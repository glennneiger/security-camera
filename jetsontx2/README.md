Before running you need to install tensorflow for Jetson Nano. Official instructions can be found [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-tf-jetson-platform/index.html).


After installing tensorflow, you need to run the `compile_ssd_mobilenet.py` script from your project directory.   
**Note**: You only need to do this the first time.

```Shell
cd project_directory
python3 compile_ssd_mobilenet.py
```
